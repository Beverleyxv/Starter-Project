        <strong>F</strong>ashion has been a part of our existence since the
        beginning of time and it has since evolved over decades and centuries. I
        love so many different luxury brands however, I am currently
        <em>obssessed</em>
        with Yves Saint Laurent. The eponymous brand was established in 1962 by
        designer Yves Saint Laurent and his partner, Pierre Berg√©. The company
        specializes in haute couture, ready-to-wear, leather accessories, and
        footwear. During the 1960s and 1970s, YSL popularized the beatnik look,
        safari jackets, tight pants, and thigh-high boots. The brand expanded in
        the 1980s and early 1990s with men's and women's fragrances, building
        upon its cosmetic line introduced in 1978. At present, YSL produces all
        sorts of fashion pieces including handbags, shoes, jewellery and
        cosmetics.
